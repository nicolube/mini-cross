 |
 | Statement of Purpose
 |
 | The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 | exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 | and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 | authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 |
 | Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
 | the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 | scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
 | of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
 | works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
 | and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
 | These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
 | culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
 | works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
 | part through the use and efforts of others.
 |
 | For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 | expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 | associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
 | is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
 | elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
 | terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
 | Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 |
 | 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 | protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 | Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
 | limited to, the following:
 |
 |   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
 |      communicate, and translate a Work;
 |  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 | iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 |      likeness depicted in a Work;
 |  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 |      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 |   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
 |      in a Work;
 |  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
 |      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 |      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
 |      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
 |      directive); and
 | vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
 |      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
 |      implementations thereof.
 |
 | 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 | of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 | irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
 | Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
 | of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
 | future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
 | worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
 | treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
 | medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
 | including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 | purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
 | member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
 | successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
 | revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
 | equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
 | as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 |
 | 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
 | be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
 | Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
 | account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
 | extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
 | person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
 | irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
 | Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
 | maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
 | time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
 | of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
 | limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
 | "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
 | applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
 | reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 | partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
 | of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
 | will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
 | Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
 | action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
 | express Statement of Purpose.
 |
 | 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 |
 |  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 |     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 |  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
 |     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
 |     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
 |     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
 |     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
 |     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
 |     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 |  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 |     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
 |     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
 |     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
 |     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
 |     Work.
 |  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 |     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
 |     this CC0 or use of the Work.
